## 3.93.9 Formulating Algorithms with Top-Down, Stepwise Refinement Case Study 2: Sentinel-Controlled Iteration

### Sentinel Values

+ A __sentinel value__ (also called a __signal value__, a __dummy value__, or a __flag value__) is used in a sentinel-controlled loop to indicate the “end of data entry.”

+ __Sentinel-controlled iteration__ is often called _indefinite iteration_ because the number of iterations is not known before the loop begins executing.

+ The __sentinel value__ must be chosen so that it cannot be confused with an acceptable input value.

### Top-Down, Stepwise Refinement

In __top-down__, __stepwise refinement__, the top is a statement that conveys the program’s overall function. It’s a complete representation of a program. In the refinement process, we divide the top into smaller tasks and list these in execution order.

for Example:

```pseudocode
    Determine the class average for the quiz
```

So we now begin the refinement process. We divide the __top__ into smaller tasks listed in the order in which they need to be performed.This results in the following first refinement:

```pseudocode

Initialize variables
Input, sum, and count the quiz grades
Calculate and print the class average
```

### Second Refinement

To proceed to the next level of refinement, the __second refinement__, we commit to specific variables.

for Example The pseudocode statement:

```pseudocode
Initialize variables
```

can be refined as follows:

```pseudocode
Initialize total to zero
Initialize counter to zero
```

>[!CAUTION]
>We’re being careful here to test for the possibility of __division by zero__ a `fatal error` that, if undetected, would cause the `program to fail` (often called `“crashing”`).

### Complete Second Refinement

```pseudocode
Initialize total to zero
Initialize counter to zero

Input the first grade (possibly the sentinel)
While the user has not as yet entered the sentinel
    Add this grade into the running total
    Add one to the grade counter
    Input the next grade (possibly the sentinel)

    If the counter is not equal to zero
        Set the average to the total divided by the counter
        Print the average
    else
        Print “No grades were entered”

```

### Phases in a Basic Program

Many programs can be divided logically into three phases:

+ an __initialization phase__ that initializes the program variables

+ a __processing phase__ that inputs data values and adjusts program variables accordingly

+ a __termination phase__ that calculates and prints the final results.

### Number of Pseudocode Refinements

Sometimes more levels are necessary. You terminate the top-down, stepwise refinement process when the pseudocode algorithm provides sufficient detail for you to convert the pseudocode to C.

### Class-Average Program for an Arbitrary Number of Grades

data type `double` to handle numbers with decimal points—that is, __floating-point numbers__.

### Class-average program with sentinel-controlled iteration

```C
   // fig03_04.c
   // Class-average program with sentinel-controlled iteration.
   #include <stdio.h>

   // function main begins program execution
   int main(void) {
   // initialization phase
       int total = 0; // initialize total
       int counter = 0; // initialize loop counter

      // processing phase
      // get first grade from user
      printf("%s", "Enter grade, -1 to end: "); // prompt for input
      int grade = 0; // grade value
      scanf("%d", &grade); // read grade from user

      // loop while sentinel value not yet read from user
      while (grade != -1) {
          total = total + grade; // add grade to total
          counter = counter + 1; // increment counter

          // get next grade from user
          printf("%s", "Enter grade, -1 to end: "); // prompt for input
          scanf("%d", &grade); // read next grade
      } // end while

      // termination phase
      // if user entered at least one grade
      if (counter != 0) {

          // calculate average of all grades entered
          double average = (double) total / counter; // avoid truncation

          // display average with two digits of precision
          printf("Class average is %.2f\n", average);
      } // end if
      else { // if no grades were entered, output message
          puts("No grades were entered");
      } // end else
  } // end function main
```

### Always Use Braces in a while Statement

Without this while loop’s braces (lines 18 and 25), only the statement on line 19 would be in the loop’s body. The code would be incorrectly interpreted as

```C
while (grade != -1)
total = total + grade; // add grade to total
counter = counter + 1; // increment counter
// get next grade from user
printf("%s", "Enter grade, -1 to end: "); // prompt for input
scanf("%d", &grade); // read next grade
```

__This would cause an infinite loop if the user did not input -1 as the first grade__.

### Converting Between Types Explicitly and Implicitly

+ Dividing two ints results in __integer division__ any fractional part of the calculation is truncated (that is, lost).

+ C provides the __unary cast operator__ to accomplish this task.

```C
double average = (double) total / counter;
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>uses the cast operator `(double)` to create a _temporary_ __floating-point__ _copy_ of its operand, `total`. The value stored in total is still an integer.
>
>Using a cast operator in this manner is called __explicit conversion__.
>
>In mixed-type expressions, the compiler performs an operation called __implicit conversion__ on selected operands to ensure that they’re of the same type.
>

A __cast__ is a __unary operator__ that takes only one operand.

### Formatting Floating-Point Numbers

useing the printf conversion __specification__ `%.2f` to format average’s value. The `f` specifies that a __floating-point__ value will be printed. The `.2` is the precision the value will have two (2) digits to the right of the decimal point.
If the `%f` conversion specification is used without specifying the precision, the __default precision__ is 6 digits to the right of the decimal point, as if the conversion specification %.6f had been used. 
When floating-point values are printed with precision, the printed value is __rounded__ to the indicated number of decimal positions. 

```C
printf("%.2f\n", 3.446); // displays 3.45
printf("%.1f\n", 3.446); // displays 3.4
```
