## 3.11 Assignment Operators

C provides several assignment operators for abbreviating assignment expressions. For example, the statement

```C
c = c + 3;
```

can be abbreviated with the __addition assignment operator +=__ as

```C
c += 3;
```

__Assume__:

```C
int c = 3, d = 5, e = 4, f = 6, g = 12;
```

+ c = 3
+ d = 5
+ e = 4
+ f = 6
+ g = 12

|Assignment operator|Sample expression|Explanation|Assigns|
|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
|+=|c += 7|c = c + 7|10 to c|
|-=|d -= 4|d = d - 4|1 to d|
|*=|e *= 5|e = e * 5|20 to e|
|/=|f /= 3|f = f / 3|2 to f|
|%=|g %= 9|g = g % 9|3 to g|
