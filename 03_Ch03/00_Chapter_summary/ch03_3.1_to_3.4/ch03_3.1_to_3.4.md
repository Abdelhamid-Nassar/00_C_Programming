# Chapter 03

## 3.1 Introduction

 Before writing a program to solve a particular problem, you must have a thorough understanding of the problem and a carefully planned approach to solving it.

## 3.2 Algorithms

 The solution to any computing problem involves executing a series of actions in a _specific order_. An **algorithm** is a **procedure** for solving a problem in terms of:

1. the **actions** to execute.
2. the **order** in which these actions should execute.

 Specifying the order in which statements should execute in a computer program is called **program control**.

## 3.3 Pseudocode

+ **Pseudocode** is an artificial and informal language that helps you develop algorithms.
+ **Pseudocode** is similar to everyday English; it’s not an actual computer programming anguage.
+ **Pseudocode** programs help you “think out” a program.
+ **Pseudocode** consists purely of characters. You may type pseudocode using any text editor.
+ Carefully prepared pseudocode can be converted easily to corresponding C programs.
+ **Pseudocode** consists only of actions and decisions.

## 3.4 Control Structures

Normally, statements in a program execute one after the other in the order in which you write them. This is called **sequential execution**.
As you’ll soon see, various C statements enable you to specify that the next statement to execute may be other than the next one in sequence. This is called **transfer of control**.

_Böhm and Jacopini’s_ work demonstrated that all programs could be written in terms of three **control structures**:

+ namely the **sequence structure**,
+ the **selection structure** and
+ the **iteration structure**.

The **sequence structure** is simple—unless directed otherwise, the computer executes C statements one after the other in the order in which they’re written.

### Flowcharts

A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm or of a portion of an algorithm.You draw flowcharts using certain special-purpose symbols such as **rectangles**, **diamonds**, **rounded rectangles**, and **small circles**, connected by arrows called **flowlines**

**Flowlines** indicate the order in which the actions are performed.
**Rectangle (or action) symbol** indicates any action, such as a calculation, input or output
**rounded rectangle symbol** containing “Begin”, and the last is a rounded rectangle containing “End”.

When drawing only a portion of an algorithm, we omit the rounded rectangle symbols in favor of using small circles called **connector symbols**.

### Selection Statements in C

C provides three types of selection structures in the form of statements:

+ The **if _single-selection statement_** (Section 3.5) selects (performs) an action (or group of actions) only if a condition is _true_.
+ The **if…else _double-selection statement_** (Section 3.6) performs one action (or group of actions) if a condition is _true_ and a different action (or group of actions) if the condition is _false_.
+ The **switch _multiple-selection statement_** performsone of many different actions, depending on the value of an expression.

### Iteration Statements in C

C provides three types of iteration structures in the form of statements:

+ **while**
+ **do…while**
+ **for**

These statements perform tasks repeatedly.

### Summary of Control Statements

C has only seven control statements: **sequence**, **three types of selection** and **three types of iteration**.

**Control-statement** flowchart segments can be attached to one another with control-statement
stacking connecting the exit point of one to the entry point of the next.
Control statements also may be **nested**.
C uses **single-entry/single-exit control statements**.
